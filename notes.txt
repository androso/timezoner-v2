Problem: if i sign in with discord and then with google, it lets me do it.
Side effects:
 1. The provider info is filled with the google info.
 2. photoURL and username are the same as in discord.

 Observations:
  - on mobile: i need to put email and password in the browser, even though i have logged in with google in my phone (outside the browser)
    - Is it because i'm using redirect instead of popup?
